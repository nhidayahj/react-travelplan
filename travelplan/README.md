# Project Summary
This webpage is build to target travellers who are planning their next trip itinerary. It provides an
insight to popular destinations visited, and where previous travellers are encouraged to post reviews
of their visited places and their experiences. It provides a one-stop global information page that gathers 
recommendations.

# How to use 
The webpage is categorized on countries and in each country's reviews are grouped by Accommodation, 
Restaurants and Activities. These 3 categories are the webpage filter structure so users can 
navigate and look for reviews in these categories easily. However, there are also search fields for users
to do more flexible searches such as: 
- seaching by city name of the country, 
- name of the place/building or package deals 
- review tags 

These searches can operate standalone or on combination. 

# Strategy 
## Identifying External users
While this page can be useful for people who are planning their trip's itinerary, it can also be a general 
browsing page for public to have an insight of what are the popular common destination people visited and 
the kind of activities that the country/city provides to make it standout in attracting tourists. 

## Identifying External Users' Issues 
Generally if someone is to plan for their trip, they will like to hear experiences from other like-minded 
travellers as well. For example, in terms of travel activities where different people has different travelling styles and 
itinerary they will like to experience. Hence, this page provides a range of activity where travllers can 
upload a review based on Adventurous Outdoor, Cultural Exchanges and trying out local Arts and Crafts workshops. 


## Identifying External Users' Goals 
While a travel itinerary for one traveller varies between another, there can be some similarities. If both 
have interest in outdoor sports/activities, users can search using the type of outdoor activity they want to experience. 
In this webpage, when past traveller post an outdoor review, they are provided a list of outdoor activities where
they can select. Therefore, when filtering a search user can look specifically on that activity and what kind of packages deals 
or places that offers such activity. Hence, users are provided with a variety of activity packages that they can plan on 
which they would like to consider trying. 

## Site Owner's Goals 
The goal of this webpage is to help build a travel itinerary for travellers. Planning of a trip is a very exciting process, therefore,
having many options of travel information in one place is useful. User can look for different types of Accommodation 
from hotels, airbnb or hostel, to activity experiences and recommendations of eateries which are the essential travelling 
itinerary every traveller looks out for.
